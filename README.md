# Scraped Streaming Data Sources

This repo is a companion to the [awesome-streaming-data-sources](https://github.com/apgiorgi/awesome-streaming-data-sources) repo, where we employ 'git scraping' on some selected data feeds, using the [Flat Data](https://next.github.com/projects/flat-data) project.

Each data feed has it's own directory and GitHub Actions workflow.

- [NOAA National Data Buoy Center - Latest Observations](./NOAA-NDBC/)
